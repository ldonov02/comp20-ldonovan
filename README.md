COMP 20 Spring 2016 Private Repo for Laura Donovan

1. The purpose of this Git repository is to hold the code I've written for COMP20 Web Programming.

2. My favorite lab was lab 4 because I enjoyed learning about responsive design and how simply/elegantly it could be implemented.  My favorite assignment was assignment 2 because I liked doing front-end work, everything just kind of came together (aside from that one error), and I got to play around with the Google Maps API.

3. I think I've definitely grown as a programmer since this course began. Now I can use the logic of several programming languages instead of being stuck in the C++ mindset. Additionally, now I have a greater understanding of how the web works and some more tools and knowhow on what I can do with it.  

4. The most important thing that I learned in this course is how to take charge of my own learning. During COMP20, I have learned to seek out information instead of immediately asking someone to tell me what to do: when completing any given assignment, I have had upwards of five stackexchange tabs open at any time. Secondly, when I needed in-person help on Assignment 3, I utilized in-person resources at Halligan, but I made certain to only ask fully-formed questions instead of asking for general help. This allowed me to write my own code and only turn to TAs when I couldn't surpass a roadblock instead of over-relying on the help of others.

5. The topic into which I would now like to dive deeper would probably be applying what I've learned of JavaScript to new problems, as I'm interested in potentially developing a mobile app. On the other hand, I might also like to learn other programming languages, such as Ruby or Python. Either way, going forward, I think I will take COMP40 because I would like to improve my programming skills and approach to computer science.
