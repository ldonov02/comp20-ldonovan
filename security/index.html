	<h1>Assignment 4: Security</h1>
	<h4>by Laura Donovan, 4/26/2016</h4>
	<h2>Introduction</h2> <!-- Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do-->
		<p>This is a security assessment of M. Pokharen's web application, <a href="http://pure-woodland-98314.herokuapp.com/">Landmarks</a>. The purpose of this web application is to take in users' login, latitude, and longitude, insert it into a database, and use that cumulative user information to render markers for users as well as for nearby historical landmarks on a map.</p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2> <!--Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used-->
		<p>First, I performed black-box testing: because the default page on the web application showed multiple users' logins, latitudes, and longitudes, I knew that these fields were being entered into a database. I used curl to insert my own HTML or JavaScript code into the database. Then, I looked at the source code.</p> <script>alert("FINISH THIS AFTER FINDING 3RD VULNERABILITY");</script>
	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2> <!--Abstract of Findings - Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.-->
		<p>There were </p>
	<h2>Issues Found</h2> <!--
        Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
        Location / page where issue was found
        Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
        Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
        Proof of vulnerability. Screenshots are important.
        Resolution. Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved. Show code if possible.-->
		<ol>
			<li>Issue #1: Injection</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Location: This issue is in the POST API ('/sendLocation').</li>
				<li>Severity: Moderate-- in this case, I only injected HTML code but this could be much worse, involving alteration of existing database records.</li> <!--justify-->
				<li>Description of issue: The three key-value pairs posted to /sendLocation are not checked or sanitized, just inserted as-is into the checkins database. A user can input their own HTML (or NoSQL) code or just bad data, altering the veracity of the map's representation of user information or even compromising the collection itself. </li>
				<li>Proof of vulnerability: <img ref="injection_example.png" alt="injection"></li> 
				<li>Resolution: check and sanitize user input. <script>alert("give recommended code!!!");</script></li>
			</ul>
			<li>Issue #2: Cross-Site Scripting</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Location: POST API</li>
				<li>Severity: High. This is one of OWASP's top security risks. The user can </li> <!--justify-->
